# CacheSimulation
Cache Simulation - Computer Architecture 

You are to design and implement a software simulation of a cache memory subsystem. You can use any language. Note that any real cache is invisible to software. This will be a simulation of the way that a real cache works. Your "cache" will be a software structure/class that will contain information similar (but on a smaller and more simplified scale) to what would be in a real cache. Your "main memory" will be a 2K array. You can make it an array of integers or shorts (16-bits), but because it is simulating a byte-addressable memory, you won't be putting any value larger than 0xFF (255 decimal or 11111111 binary) in it.
